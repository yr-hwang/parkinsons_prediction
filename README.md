# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or not. StandardScaler was used to standardize the data, Support Vector Machine model was used for prediction, and accuracy_score was used to evaluate the accuracy on both the training and test data.

This project was done with reference to the video below:
